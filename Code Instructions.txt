To declare a new data transfer class:
- Declare a new enum sendCode in NetworkManager.cs
- Declare the class in NetworkManager.cs
- It has to have a default Constructor (empty) to be able to be serialized and deserialized
- It has to have another constructor (custom parameters or simply a bool to be different) with the assignation of the sendCode
- Declare a new case in the switch of SetTargetsAsChecked() in ConnectionManager.cs
- Declare a new case in the switch of DeserializeJsonAndReceive() in ConnectionManager.cs with response
- Usually, you need to declare a new function for doing the response when the message arrives (receive_XXX())
